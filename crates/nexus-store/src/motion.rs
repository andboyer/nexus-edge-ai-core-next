//! Motion timeline & clip recording.
//!
//! Two tables back this module:
//!
//! * `motion_clips` — one row per recorded clip. M2.2 introduced the
//!   *dual-pointer* shape: every row tracks an optional **hot**
//!   pointer (`hot_handle` + `hot_path`, where `hot_handle` always
//!   resolves to a local-disk-backed [`storage_backends`] entry like
//!   `'local'` or `'usb-vault'`) and an optional **cold** pointer
//!   (`cold_handle` + `cold_path` + `cold_uploaded_at`, populated by
//!   the cold-mirror replicator). The schema CHECK guarantees at
//!   least one of the two is non-NULL — a clip row never points at
//!   nothing.
//! * `motion_events` — many-rows-per-clip; the per-track lifecycle
//!   timeline (`born` / `updated` / `died`) keyed by `(camera_id,
//!   captured_at)`.
//!
//! All FKs to `motion_clips(id)` are `ON DELETE CASCADE` (see
//! `0002_motion_clips.sql` + `0003_events_clip_cascade.sql`), so
//! hard-eviction is a single `DELETE motion_clips WHERE id = ?`.
//! Hard-eviction is only legal for clips that were NEVER replicated
//! to cold (M2.2 invariant) — soft-eviction
//! ([`Store::clear_hot_pointer`]) is the right call when a cold copy
//! exists and we just need the bytes off hot disk.
//!
//! The FKs from `motion_clips.hot_handle` and `motion_clips.cold_handle`
//! to `storage_backends.handle` are `ON DELETE RESTRICT` — operators
//! cannot delete a backend while any clip still references it. The
//! application's [`Store::delete_storage_backend`] helper enforces the
//! same rule explicitly so the error surfaces as `DeleteBackendError`
//! instead of a raw `sqlx::Error`.
