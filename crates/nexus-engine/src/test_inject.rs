//! M7 Step 6F2 — dev-only event-injection endpoint.
//!
//! Gated behind the `test-injection` cargo feature on
//! `nexus-engine` so this code is compiled OUT of any normal
//! (production / release) build. The Playwright e2e suite builds
//! with `--features test-injection` to expose
//! `POST /api/v1/_test/inject_event`, which lets a test write a
//! ready-made `AlertEvent` straight into the outbox via the same
//! `Store::record_event_and_enqueue` path the rule engine uses in
//! production.
//!
//! Why an endpoint and not a CLI tool / direct DB write:
//!
//! * Goes through `record_event_and_enqueue`, so the FK to
//!   `cameras` is checked and the per-sink fan-out is identical
//!   to a real rule fire (cascade policy on the dispatcher side
//!   runs unchanged — that's the whole point of the test).
//! * Survives sqlite WAL boundaries: a separate process writing
//!   to the DB would race the engine's pool; an HTTP call serialises
//!   through the same connection pool.
//!
//! Security posture:
//!
//! * Feature-gated → endpoint literally does not exist in the
//!   compiled binary unless the operator opts in at build time.
//! * Skips the admin-auth gate by design — the e2e fixture runs
//!   under `auth.mode = "none"` on loopback. If someone ever wants
//!   to enable this in a half-secured environment they should add
//!   their own gate before the route registration in `api.rs`.
