//! M2.2 Phase 1 — cold-mirror replicator.
//!
//! A single follower task that copies closed clips from the local
//! hot tier onto the configured cold backend. Two design rules are
//! load-bearing and MUST stay true at every refactor:
//!
//! 1. **The replicator NEVER deletes from source.** It only ever
//!    *adds* a cold pointer to a row. Deletion of the hot copy is
//!    the eviction path's job (see [`crate::storage_safety`]) and
//!    the eviction path will refuse to soft-evict any row that
//!    isn't already cold-replicated.
//!
//! 2. **There is exactly one active cold backend at a time.** It's
//!    the row pointed at by `storage_cold_replica.backend_handle`.
//!    A NULL handle (or a handle that doesn't resolve in the
//!    [`Registry`]) means "cold disabled" — the replicator skips
//!    every tick quietly and does NOT emit unreachable warnings
//!    (those are reserved for "configured but cannot reach").
//!
//! The replicator is event-driven on `topic::CLIP_CLOSED` and has a
//! 5-minute polling backstop so a missed bus event (e.g. lagged
//! subscriber on engine restart) can never strand a clip outside
//! cold for more than that interval. Both triggers funnel into the
//! same `tick()` body that drains
//! [`Store::clips_pending_cold_upload`] in oldest-first order.

// * Event-driven pickup (CLIP_CLOSED triggers an immediate tick
//   well before the 5-min polling backstop)
// * Cold-disabled fast skip (backend_handle is NULL → no put())
// * Unreachable backend emits STORAGE_COLD_UNREACHABLE EXACTLY
