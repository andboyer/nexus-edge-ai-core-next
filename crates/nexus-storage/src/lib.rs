//! M2.2 cold-mirror replication: backend abstraction + LAN impl.
//!
//! ## Why a separate crate?
//!
//! The cold-mirror layer is intentionally isolated from the engine
//! and from the M2.1 hot-storage code path. Three reasons:
//!
//!   1. **Recorder unaware of cold.** The recorder writes to the hot
//!      backend only; the cold replicator follower is the *only*
//!      caller of `ColdBackend::put`. Putting the trait in a leaf
//!      crate keeps it physically impossible to accidentally call
//!      from the recorder.
//!
//!   2. **Cloud backends land in `nexus-storage-cloud`** (Phase 2).
//!      That crate has heavy dependencies (oauth2, reqwest, AES-GCM)
//!      that core deployments without cloud access have no business
//!      pulling. The split mirrors the M3.1 visual-feature add-on.
//!
//!   3. **Trait-object dispatch.** The replicator holds an
//!      `Arc<dyn ColdBackend>` so the active cold target can be
//!      hot-swapped via the admin API without rebuilding any
//!      pipeline state. A standalone crate is the cleanest place
//!      to define + document that contract.
//!
//! ## The contract
//!
//! See [`ColdBackend`] for the full trait. Three invariants every
//! impl must honour:
//!
//!   * `put` is **idempotent** — re-uploading the same `(handle,
//!     path, sha256)` triple after a partial failure must succeed
//!     without duplicating bytes. The replicator may retry on
//!     transient failures and rely on this.
//!   * `delete` is a no-op on the *source* file. The replicator
//!     never deletes from cold (M2.2 spec invariant); cold deletion
//!     is operator-driven via the admin API only.
//!   * `exists` returns `true` only for *complete, non-torn*
//!     uploads. The strict variant in `LanFsBackend::exists` does a
//!     stat + first/last 64 KB sha256 spot-check to guard against
//!     the case where a previous upload crashed mid-write and left
//!     a partial file with the right name.
