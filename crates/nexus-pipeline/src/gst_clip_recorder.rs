//! GStreamer-backed clip recorder — M2.1 Stage B (PR B2 + B8 refactor).
//!
//! Per-clip pipeline lifecycle (post-B8 — single RTSP connection per
//! camera, fed by [`PreRollIngester`]):
//!
//! ```text
//!   appsrc name=src is-live=true format=time do-timestamp=false
//!     ! h264parse config-interval=-1
//!     ! mp4mux fragment-duration=5000 streamable=true faststart=true
//!     ! filesink location=/var/lib/nexus/clips/cam1/...mp4
//! ```
//!
//! At [`ClipRecorder::open`]:
//!
//!   1. Build the appsrc-headed mp4 writer and start it Playing.
//!   2. Snapshot the camera's pre-roll ring buffer
//!      ([`PreRollIngester::snapshot`]) and push every sample into
//!      appsrc. The first sample is always a keyframe (the ring
//!      buffer guarantees GOP alignment); we use it as the t=0
//!      anchor and rebase all PTS/DTS to start at zero so mp4mux
//!      writes a sane track timeline.
//!   3. Subscribe to the ingester's live broadcast channel; spawn an
//!      async pump that forwards every new live sample into appsrc
//!      until close() fires (or the recorder is dropped).
//!
//! At [`ClipRecorder::close`]:
//!
//!   1. Signal the live pump to stop and wait for it to drain.
//!   2. Send EOS into appsrc → flows through h264parse → mp4mux
//!      finalises moov → filesink closes the file.
//!   3. Wait on bus for EOS message (or 5s timeout) and null the
//!      pipeline.
//!   4. stat() the resulting file, stamp `ended_at` / `duration_ms`
//!      / `size_bytes` on the `motion_clips` row.
//!
//! Hard invariants:
//!
//! * **One RTSP connection per camera, lifetime = process lifetime.**
//!   The per-clip rtspsrc of pre-B8 is gone; all NAL traffic comes
//!   in via the always-on [`PreRollIngester`]. This avoids the
//!   re-handshake stutter at every clip open and means cheap
//!   cameras (4-connection limits) don't get hammered.
//! * **No re-encode.** appsrc receives byte-stream H.264 from the
//!   ingester; mp4mux just wraps it.
//! * **Pre-roll prepended.** Every clip starts with the ring
//!   buffer's snapshot — typically ~5s of footage from BEFORE the
//!   triggering motion event. `pre_roll_secs=0` produces an empty
//!   snapshot and the recording starts at the first live sample,
//!   matching pre-B8 behaviour.
//! * **Fragmented mp4** so a kill-mid-write leaves a partially-
//!   readable file.
//! * **Codec is `h264`, container is `mp4`** stamped on the row.
//! * **Refused on panic.** Same semantics as `StubClipRecorder`: the
//!   watermark sampler flips `set_panic(true)` when the disk is hot
//!   and `open()` returns `RecorderError::Refused`.
//!
//! Per-camera ingester resolution: the recorder is constructed with
//! a snapshot of `HashMap<CameraId, Arc<PreRollIngester>>` from the
//! engine boot. A camera added at runtime that isn't in the snapshot
//! triggers a `Refused` with a one-shot warn log; the operator
//! restarts the engine to pick up the new camera. (Same hot-reload
//! limitation as everything else upstream.)
