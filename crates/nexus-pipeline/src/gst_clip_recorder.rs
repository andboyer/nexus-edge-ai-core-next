//! GStreamer-backed clip recorder — M2.1 Stage B (PR B2 + B8 refactor).
//!
//! Per-clip pipeline lifecycle (post-B8 — single RTSP connection per
//! camera, fed by [`PreRollIngester`]):
//!
//! ```text
//!   appsrc name=src is-live=true format=time do-timestamp=false
//!     ! h264parse config-interval=0
//!     ! mp4mux fragment-duration=5000 streamable=true faststart=true
//!     ! filesink location=/var/lib/nexus/clips/cam1/...mp4
//! ```
//!
//! `config-interval=0` (trust the source) is critical: the upstream
//! [`PreRollIngester`] already runs its own h264parse and emits
//! source-natural byte-stream with SPS+PPS in front of every IDR
//! (true for every modern IP camera we've tested — InSight, Reolink,
//! mediamtx loopbacks). If this h264parse uses `config-interval=-1`
//! ("insert SPS+PPS before every IDR") it DOUBLES the parameter sets
//! to `[AUD, SPS, PPS, SPS, PPS, IDR]`. The duplicated SPS/PPS look
//! like the start of a NEW access unit to the parser's own framing
//! logic; the synthetic AU inherits no PTS from the source buffer,
//! and mp4mux silently rejects every PTS-less buffer with the
//! cryptic `error: Buffer has no PTS.` (gstqtmux.c:5927). The on-
//! disk file ends at 864 bytes (ftyp+moov stub) and the bus error
//! at EOS is the generic `Could not multiplex stream.` with no
//! further context. Diagnose with `GST_DEBUG=qtmux:5,h264parse:4`.
//!
//! Same-PTS sample coalescing ([`coalesce_same_pts`]): some IP
//! cameras (the InSight at `192.168.1.66` on our bench, both
//! `stream1` and `stream2`) emit access units the upstream
//! [`PreRollIngester`]'s h264parse splits into TWO appsink
//! emissions sharing one PTS — one tiny buffer carrying just
//! `[AUD, SEI]` (~35 bytes) and a second carrying the actual
//! `[slice ...]` payload. The recorder's h264parse sees these as
//! two separate AUs; it emits the first to mp4mux as a 35-byte
//! buffer WITH NO PTS (because the AU it represents is incomplete
//! until the slice arrives) which mp4mux flags as
//! `Sample with zero duration ... due to missing or backward
//! timestamps`. The very next valid buffer then trips the
//! `Buffer has no PTS` error against the cached previous buffer
//! and the whole clip dies at 864 bytes. We re-aggregate by
//! buffering any sample whose PTS equals the pending sample's PTS
//! and concatenating their byte-stream data into one push — both
//! in the snapshot pre-push pass and in the live pump. mp4mux
//! sees one PTS-bearing AU per frame and writes a healthy clip.
//! Live-pump pending buffers are flushed on a 200 ms inactivity
//! timer so a stalled stream can't strand the very last AU.
//!
//! At [`ClipRecorder::open`]:
//!
//!   1. Build the appsrc-headed mp4 writer and start it Playing.
//!   2. Snapshot the camera's pre-roll ring buffer
//!      ([`PreRollIngester::snapshot`]) and push every sample into
//!      appsrc. The first sample is always a keyframe (the ring
//!      buffer guarantees GOP alignment); we use it as the t=0
//!      anchor and rebase all PTS/DTS to start at zero so mp4mux
//!      writes a sane track timeline.
//!   3. Subscribe to the ingester's live broadcast channel; spawn an
//!      async pump that forwards every new live sample into appsrc
//!      until close() fires (or the recorder is dropped).
//!
//! At [`ClipRecorder::close`]:
//!
//!   1. Signal the live pump to stop and wait for it to drain.
//!   2. Send EOS into appsrc → flows through h264parse → mp4mux
//!      finalises moov → filesink closes the file.
//!   3. Wait on bus for EOS message (or 5s timeout) and null the
//!      pipeline.
//!   4. stat() the resulting file, stamp `ended_at` / `duration_ms`
//!      / `size_bytes` on the `motion_clips` row.
//!
//! Hard invariants:
//!
//! * **One RTSP connection per camera, lifetime = process lifetime.**
//!   The per-clip rtspsrc of pre-B8 is gone; all NAL traffic comes
//!   in via the always-on [`PreRollIngester`]. This avoids the
//!   re-handshake stutter at every clip open and means cheap
//!   cameras (4-connection limits) don't get hammered.
//! * **No re-encode.** appsrc receives byte-stream H.264 from the
//!   ingester; mp4mux just wraps it.
//! * **Pre-roll prepended.** Every clip starts with the ring
//!   buffer's snapshot — typically ~5s of footage from BEFORE the
//!   triggering motion event. `pre_roll_secs=0` produces an empty
//!   snapshot and the recording starts at the first live sample,
//!   matching pre-B8 behaviour.
//! * **Fragmented mp4** so a kill-mid-write leaves a partially-
//!   readable file.
//! * **Codec is `h264`, container is `mp4`** stamped on the row.
//! * **Refused on panic.** Same semantics as `StubClipRecorder`: the
//!   watermark sampler flips `set_panic(true)` when the disk is hot
//!   and `open()` returns `RecorderError::Refused`.
//!
//! Per-camera ingester resolution: the recorder is constructed with
//! a snapshot of `HashMap<CameraId, Arc<PreRollIngester>>` from the
//! engine boot, but the map is wrapped in a `parking_lot::RwLock` so
//! the engine's `config.changed` reconciler can add / remove
//! per-camera ingesters live via [`Self::add_camera_ingester`] and
//! [`Self::remove_camera_ingester`]. A camera that wasn't reconciled
//! in (e.g. ingester build error) still triggers a `Refused` with a
//! one-shot warn log at `open()` time.
