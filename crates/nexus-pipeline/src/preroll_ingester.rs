//! Always-on H.264 pre-roll ingester — M2.1 Stage B PR B8.
//!
//! Per-camera GStreamer pipeline, started at engine boot, that holds
//! the only RTSP connection for the camera and:
//!
//!   1. Maintains a 5s rolling ring buffer of byte-stream H.264 NAL
//!      samples (see [`crate::preroll::NalRingBuffer`]). When motion
//!      fires, [`GstClipRecorder`] snapshots this buffer and prepends
//!      it to the new clip so the recording starts ~5s before motion
//!      onset (NVR pre-roll convention).
//!
//!   2. Fans every live sample out over a tokio broadcast channel so
//!      the active recorder can keep appending to the same clip
//!      without opening a second TCP connection to the camera.
//!
//! Pipeline:
//!
//! ```text
//!   rtspsrc location=URL latency=500 protocols=tcp
//!     ! rtph264depay
//!     ! h264parse config-interval=0
//!     ! video/x-h264,stream-format=byte-stream,alignment=au
//!     ! appsink name=tap emit-signals=true sync=false
//!         max-buffers=200 drop=false
//! ```
//!
//! `stream-format=byte-stream,alignment=au` (Annex-B, access-unit-aligned)
//! is what mp4mux's `appsrc` feed expects when we splice the snapshot
//! at clip-open.
//!
//! `config-interval=0` (do NOT insert SPS/PPS) is deliberate. We
//! used to set `-1` (insert SPS/PPS before every IDR), but that
//! interacts badly with cameras whose H.264 stream already carries
//! SPS/PPS in every keyframe access unit (most modern IP cameras —
//! confirmed on the InSight 192.168.1.66 fixture). With `-1`,
//! h264parse on the ingester emits `[AUD, SPS, PPS, SPS, PPS, IDR]`.
//! Downstream, the recorder's `h264parse → mp4mux` chain interprets
//! the second SPS/PPS pair as the start of a *new* access unit;
//! that synthetic AU inherits no PTS from the source buffer, and
//! qtmux silently rejects every PTS-less buffer with the cryptic
//! `"Could not multiplex stream."` on EOS — leaving a 864-byte
//! ftyp+moov stub on disk. With `config-interval=0` we pass the
//! camera's byte-stream through unchanged: cameras that already
//! include SPS/PPS per keyframe work end-to-end, and clips for
//! cameras that DON'T (some Axis/Hikvision models in legacy modes)
//! only become un-decodable when the snapshot starts mid-GOP — a
//! known limitation we can revisit by caching the most-recent
//! SPS/PPS NALs and prepending them to AUs that lack them.
//! See also `gst_clip_recorder::push_sample` for the per-buffer
//! PTS synthesis that complements this fix.
//!
//! Re-connect strategy: the ingester runs an async supervisor that
//! tears the pipeline down and rebuilds it on bus error or EOS, with
//! exponential backoff capped at 30s. The ring buffer survives
//! reconnect (we keep what we last buffered) but is NOT rewound — a
//! camera that drops for 60s leaves a 60s pre-roll gap on the next
//! recording, which is still better than zero pre-roll.
//!
//! Memory cost: roughly `bitrate_bytes_per_sec * pre_roll_secs`.
//! ~2 MB per camera at 4 Mbps 1080p, ~5 MB at 4K. Bounded by the
//! ring buffer itself; the broadcast channel is capped (see
//! [`BROADCAST_CAPACITY`]) to keep a slow recorder from blocking
//! the streaming thread.
