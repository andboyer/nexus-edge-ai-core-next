//! Enrollment client. Phase 1.7 wires the HTTP body against the
//! cloud-side `POST /v1/enroll` handler in
//! `nexus-cloud-console/services/enrollment-svc/src/handlers.rs`.
//!
//! At enrollment time the engine:
//!
//! 1. Generates a fresh keypair, builds a CSR.
//! 2. Computes its hardware fingerprint (TPM EK / CPU serial / etc.).
//! 3. POSTs `{code, csr_pem, fingerprint}` to
//!    `https://<cloud-host>/v1/enroll`.
//! 4. Persists `cert_pem`, `ca_chain_pem`, and `entitlement_jwt` under
//!    the enrollment artifact directory.
//! 5. Pins `gateway_url` for the [`crate::tunnel::TunnelClient`].
//!
//! ## actor_token verifying-key bundling
//!
//! The cloud-side `EnrollResponse` includes the entitlement signer's
//! public key (PEM) and its `kid` so the engine's
//! [`crate::rpc::RpcDispatcher`] can be seeded at enrollment time
//! without an out-of-band key fetch. Both fields remain `Option<T>` on
//! the wire for forward / backward compatibility with older cloud
//! deployments that pre-date Phase 1.7c.
